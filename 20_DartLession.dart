//-- Functions in Dart 

/*

- Function is the self-contained block of statements that performs a specific task.
- It takes some data as input, processes it, and returns the result as an output.
- It divides larger programs into small parts.
- Itâ€™s a reusable component in a program.
- It increases readability and makes the program simple to understand and maintain.
- A function in Dart is an object; it can be assigned to variables, passed as a parameter to another function, and used as a returned value as well.
- A method is the function written inside the class, whereas a function is just an individual entity.

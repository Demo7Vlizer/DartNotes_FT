  /* 
  Because as the name sujest that is instance variable - instance in the sense this variable x will appear in the memory 
  where only and only   when you create a instance means this variable not the individual variable .. it'll always present inside
  the object or an instance that is inside an object.. that why that's is called instance variable.. 
  and another static of x variable is not instance variable..

  //== Such varible must be access by uing class name.. - so whenever class is getting  loaded in the memory  your y variable will ready for you..

  //== But consider a situation where we want to call a method  or  we want to use the methods without using an object so such a methods must be a static method 
  //-- We mostly define a method static when we want to do some utility task means there is nothing to be done over the value of an object means we don't want to play with instance values rather there is some utility task to be done by the method so in that case it's preferred to make that method static

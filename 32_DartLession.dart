//-- Static Variable & Static Method in Dart | Use of static in Dart

//-- Static variabel..

/*
class Test {
  static int x =
      10; //== but as This is static - so for all the object in the program there will be single copy of y which shared by multiple objects..
  //== MoverOver static variable are asociated with the class rather than the object.. that's why they are also known as class varible..
  int y = 20; //-- this type of field is called known as non - static field..
}

void main() {
  Test obj1 = Test(); //-- from this there will be separate copy of this x
  Test obj2 = Test();

  //== if we're trying to acces like this we'll getting error..
  /* 
  Because as the name sujest that is instance variable - instance in the sense this variable x will appear in the memory 
  where only and only   when you create a instance means this variable not the individual variable .. it'll always present inside
  the object or an instance that is inside an object.. that why that's is called instance variable.. 
  and another static of x variable is not instance variable.. 
   */
  print(Test.y);       //-- In here we getting due to we're trying to access instanace variable 

  // -- if we want to access that static x variable if we try to acess by using instance like obj1 or obj2 in this case we will get error
  //== Such varible must be access by uing class name.. - so whenever class is getting  loaded in the memory  your y variable will ready for you.. 
  //-- But it's not the case with the y variable.. 
  print(Test.x);

//-- Static Methods....

/*
class Test {
  //-- Now here that Test.. class that contains show methods in line no. 39

/*
  //-- Methods -> this type of methods called instance methods.. - it's means whenever we want to use this method we must have an object so over the object we can call the method show 
  //== But consider a situation where we want to call a method  or  we want to use the methods without using an object so such a methods must be a static method 
  //-- We mostly define a method static when we want to do some utility task means there is nothing to be done over the value of an object means we don't want to play with instance values rather there is some utility task to be done by the method so in that case it's preferred to make that method static

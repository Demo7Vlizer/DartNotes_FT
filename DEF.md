## what is Dart..?
**Dart Programming Language:**
- General-purpose Object-Oriented Programming Language.
- Similar to Java and C#.
- Developed by Google, designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund.
- First unveiled at the GOTO conference in Denmark on October 10, 2011.
- **Dart 1.0:** Released in November 2013.
- **Dart 2.0:** Released in August 2018.
- Official language for Flutter.
- Applications: Mobile apps, Web apps, Desktop apps, and Server-side apps that run on multiple platforms.

## Feature of Dart.. 
**Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Dart:**
- **Class:** Defines the blueprint of an object.
- **Inheritance:** Enables a class to derive properties and methods from another class.
- **Mixin:** A way to add functionality to classes.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects data by restricting access.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows a single interface to represent different types.
- **Object:** The instance of a class.
- **Generics:** Provides flexibility to write type-safe and reusable code.
- **Exception Handling:** Manages runtime errors gracefully.
- **Interface:** Defines a contract that classes must implement.
- **Abstraction:** Hides complexity while exposing essential details.
#### - Multi platform deployment.. 

#### - This supports a Synchronous.. 
**Comparison of Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Programming:**
1. **Synchronous Programming:**
   - Tasks are executed one after another.
   - Task 1 begins first, taking 10 seconds.
   - Task 2 starts only after Task 1, taking an additional 7 seconds.
   - Task 3 follows, taking 5 seconds.
   - Finally, Task 4 starts after Task 3, taking 6 seconds.
   - **Total time taken: 28 seconds.**

2. **Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Tasks start simultaneously and run independently.
   - Task 1 takes 10 seconds.
   - Task 2, Task 3, and Task 4 begin at the same time as Task 1.
   - Task 2 takes 7 seconds, Task 3 takes 5 seconds, and Task 4 takes 6 seconds.
   - **Total time taken: 10 seconds.**

#### - **Extensive Libraries in Dart:**
- Dart provides a rich set of libraries to enhance programming.
- Examples of libraries include:

  - **Core:** Offers essential classes and functions.
  - **Async:** Supports asynchronous programming.
  - **HTML:** Useful for web programming.
  - **Collection:** Helps with managing collections like lists and sets.
  - **IO:** Facilitates input and output operations.
  - **Math:** Provides mathematical functions.
  - **Convert:** Assists in data conversion tasks.

#### - Platform Independent : All over where it can be use eg.. linux or window.. 

#### - Type safety & Null safety.. 

#### - Open source..
 
#### - Easy to learn..
